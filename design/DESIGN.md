# Streamable HTTP

  - Chunked transfer encoding is implemented in mummy_transport.nim:132 with Transfer-Encoding: chunked header
  - Automatic content negotiation detects client streaming capabilities via Accept headers
  - Proper HTTP/1.1 chunked encoding with hex-prefixed chunks ending with 0\r\n\r\n
  - Working examples in examples/streaming_example.nim

The implementation matches the design spec - server sets chunked encoding header, writes data in chunks without closing connection, and clients read chunks as they arrive.
